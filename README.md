An E-Commerce retail company based out of NYC has released sales data regarding its 
top 500 customers. The company wants to better understand the factors that influence
their revenue. The company, having platforms for their customers in the form of an App
as well as a Website, wants to analyze where their customers spend more time, and the
use of which platform generates more revenue. It is important to note that the focus of
analysis is not on what the customer purchases, but their behavior in terms of loyalty,
and average time spent on each of the two platforms. 
The project uses a data set from Kaggle (E-commerce.csv). We use Logistic Regression to
analyze some important questions and also predict the yearly expenditure of customers.
